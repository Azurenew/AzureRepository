Firewall

What is azure firewall--Azure firewall is stateful firewall, highly available (no additional load balancers are required and there's nothing you need to configure.), highly scalable.

It is paas offering

cost

1. fixed
2. inbound data transfer and outbound data transfer


1. Create resource group
2. Create virtual networks
3. Create another subnet-which will be deploying server used for testing
4. Creat virtual machine
	1. deploy on another subnet
	2. Inbound port is None
	3. Public IP is none

After creating VM, Public Ip address is not created, Networking-> Goto NIC->IP config, private ipaddress is created as dynamic.

Note:- Make it is static instead of dynamic

5. Create Firewall

	1. Add NAT  (network application traffic) rule collection
		Name, Priority-100
		Rules
		name-RDPRule
		Protocol-TCP
		Source Type-Ip address
		Source - *
		Destination Address- Firewall Public address
		Port Number-	3389
		Translated Address- VM Private address
		Translated port Number-	3389

6. Login to VM with firewall public ipaddress (mstsc)

Now you are able to access all the websites --bbc.com, google.com...

To block the sites, create a route table


7. Create Route Tables

Do the configuration after creating the route table

I) Route

	1. RouteName--Firewall_RouteTable
	2. Adress Prefix--0.0.0.0/0
	3. Next hop types-Virtual appliance (azure firewall)
	4. next hop address-Give firewall private ip address
II) Subnets

	Associate-> Vnet-give firewall_vnet, Subnet-Server1

8. Now goto VM
now you will not be access any website--all is blocked

9. To access the websites BBC or google

goto firewall-> rule-> application rule collection

	1. Application Collection Name
	2. Priority-100
	3. Action-Allow
	4. Target FQDNs-name (allow bbc), source (*), Protocol(http,https), Target FQDNs(*bbc.com)

fully qualified domain names (FQDN) including wild cards.
